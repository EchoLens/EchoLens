# EchoLens Project

## Introduction

Welcome to our EchoLens project! This project aims to build a scalable, serverless social media platform where users can share photos, videos, and other content. The goal is to learn and implement various cloud computing and data processing technologies, including AWS Lambda, Kubernetes/EKS, AWS Auto Scaling Groups, AWS API Gateway, and Kafka.

### Technologies

- **AWS Lambda:** For serverless functions triggered by HTTP requests or other AWS services.
- **EKS/Kubernetes:** For container orchestration, managing the lifecycle of our application's containers.
- **AWS Auto Scaling Group:** To automatically scale our compute resources based on the demand.
- **AWS API Gateway:** To create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
- **Kafka:** For handling real-time data feeds and messaging.
